# Fanfic ETL poject with Airflow and AWS using Lambda and Redshift 
Some years ago I read a intresting articale about a AI model that could create new poems, this was achivable since the model had a large dataset of poems. A strange idea was then created in my head, I though **"What kind of useless or funny text would you be able to create with such a model?"**. And the answer was fanfictions, and I realized that it would be a fun project to try.

I therefore started to think about some important steps, for example:<br>
1) What **cool things** should I do with the data, create fanfictions or a classification model *(seperate dirty fanfiction from normal)*?
2) Where do I **find** the data?
3) How should I **retrive** the data?
4) How should I **store** the data?
5) How should I **analyze** the data?

I therefore created a roadmap on how to get a lot of fanfictions and then store and analyze the data. 

This is the data
