# Fanfic ETL poject with Airflow and AWS using Lambda and Redshift 
Some years ago I read a intresting articale about a AI model that could create new poems, this was achivable since the model had a large dataset of poems. A strange idea was then created in my head, I though **"What kind of useless or funny text would you be able to create with such a model?"**. And the answer was fanfictions, and I realized that it would be a fun project to try.

I therefore started to think about some things, for example:<br>
1) What cool things should I do with the data, create fanfiction or a classification model?
2) Where di I **find** the data?
3) How should I **retrive** the data?
4) How should I **store** the data?
5) How should I **analyze** the data?
